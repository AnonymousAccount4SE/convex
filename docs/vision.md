Convex is an open platform for Digital Value Exchange. Throughout history, people have improved their lives and societies by exchanging good and services to fulfil their needs. Marketplaces, trade routes, legal systems, currencies and financial institutions developed to support value exchange over the centuries. In the modern world, assets are increasingly managed digitally, and in many cases are entirely digital themselves. 

* **Global Database**: A consistent, replicated database capable of tracking assets in circulation, and public information required to facilitate transactions
* **Trusted Execution**: deterministic, programmable, verifiable smart contracts that participants can rely upon to enforce terms and conditions of exchange
* **Secure Ownership**: Secure cryptographic techniques ensure that assets are under the control of the owner, and nobody else.
* **Autonomous Actors**: Self-operating, unstoppable economic agents executing on the network can automatically fulfil important roles in the digital economy, perhaps even operating as virtual companies in their own right.
* **Public Utility Network** A decentralised, public, permissionless network that anyone can access to transact without censorship or centralised gatekeepers.
