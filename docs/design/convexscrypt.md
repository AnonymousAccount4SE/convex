# Convex Scrypt

WIP Ideas

## Design Constraints

* Must be a front-end to the CVM. Should not affect underlying CVM code.
* Must work with Convex Lisp defined objects (ability to cross-utilise libraries etc.)
* Should be familiar to user of ALGOL-like langauges (C, Java, JavaScript)
* Must support infix arithmetic
