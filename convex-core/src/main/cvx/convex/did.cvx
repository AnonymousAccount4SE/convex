'convex.did

;; This is an implementation of the W3C DID specification for a Verifiable Data Registry on Convex
;;
;; This registry can be used to implement a DID method such as "did:convex:101"
;;
;; Notes
;; - IDs are sequentially allocated integers. mapping human readable names to ID is possible but outside of scope of this library
;; - The required operations Create, Read, Update and Deactivate are implemeted on-chain
;; - We regard a nil DDO as deactivated
;; - Records are internally stored as a Vector [ddo-document controller created updated]

(import convex.trust :as trust)

;; A map of ID to record vectors
