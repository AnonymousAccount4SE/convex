# Convex

## Some Inspirations

- *Haskell* - for its functional purity, and attribute which is extremely valuable for
decentralised systems.

- *Lisp* - for demonstrationg the power of homoiconicity, and the ability to bootstrap a
languge ecosystem with just a few core primatives closely linked to the Lambda Calculus.

- *Clojure* - primarily for its syntax and functional styole, an elegant evolution of Lisp
for the modern age.

- *Persistent data structures* - functional data structures that enable efficient operations
such as update while preserving previous copies of data in an immutable fashion.

- *Java* - for giving us the JVM, an unusually robust and high-performance platform
for implementing systems of this nature. 

- *Ethereum* - for demonstrating a working decentralised execution engine.

- *Bitcoin* - for demonstrating decentralised consensus, albeit in a very inefficient fashion
